            "**Here are some key facts about Sierra Leone:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **History:** The region has been inhabited for at least 2,500 years. European contact began in the 15th century, and the British established a colony for freed slaves in the late 18th century, which became Freetown. Sierra Leone gained independence from the United Kingdom on April 27, 1961. The country experienced a brutal civil war from 1991 to 2002.\n",
            "* **Geography:** It has a diverse landscape with coastal mangrove swamps, wooded hill country, an upland plateau, and mountains in the east. The highest peak is Mount Bintumani. Freetown has one of the world's largest natural harbors.\n",
            "* **Economy:** The economy is gradually recovering after the civil war, with a GDP of $7.41 billion as of 2024. Key industries include mining (diamonds, titanium ore, bauxite, iron ore, gold), small-scale manufacturing, agriculture (rice, coffee, cocoa), and fishing.\n",
            "* **Culture:** Sierra Leone has a rich and diverse culture with over 18 ethnic groups, including the Temne and Mende as the largest. English is the official language, but Krio is widely spoken. Islam is the dominant religion (around 60%), followed by Christianity (around 30%). The people are known for their friendliness and hospitality. Secret societies like the Poro (for men) and Sande (for women) play a significant role in traditional culture. Music and dance are integral to social life.\n",

            "Here are the top 10 facts about Aryabhata, the renowned mathematician and astronomer of ancient India:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Birth and Time:** Aryabhata was born in 476 CE in Kusumapura (believed to be near Patna, Bihar) during the Gupta Empire.\n",
            "* **Magnum Opus:** At the young age of 23, in 499 CE, he authored his most famous work, the *Aryabhatiya*. This book is a comprehensive treatise on mathematics and astronomy, written in verse.\n",
            "* **Concept of Zero and Decimal System:** Aryabhata is credited with the explicit introduction of zero as a digit and its crucial role in the place value system. This was a revolutionary concept that formed the basis of modern arithmetic.\n",
            "* **Approximation of Pi (π):** He provided a remarkably accurate approximation of pi (π) as 3.1416. He might have even understood that pi is irrational.\n",
            "* **Heliocentric View (Proto):** While his model was geocentric with epicycles, some interpretations suggest he hinted at or had an understanding of the Earth's rotation on its axis and possibly a heliocentric idea, centuries before Copernicus. He correctly stated that the Earth rotates on its axis, explaining the apparent movement of stars.\n",
            "* **Calculation of Earth's Circumference:** Aryabhata made a close estimate of the Earth's circumference, around 39,968 km, which is very close to the modern value.\n",
            "* **Explanation of Eclipses:** He provided a scientific explanation for solar and lunar eclipses, stating that they are caused by the shadows of the Earth and the Moon, refuting the prevailing mythological beliefs. He also correctly stated that the Moon and planets shine due to reflected sunlight.\n",
            "* **Trigonometry:** Aryabhata made significant contributions to trigonometry, including the calculation of sine and versine tables. The modern terms \"sine\" and \"cosine\" are derived from his Sanskrit terms \"jya\" and \"koti-jya.\"\n",
            "* **Algebra:** He is often considered the \"Father of Algebra\" for his work on solving indeterminate equations and his algebraic approach to astronomical problems.\n",
            "* **Influence and Legacy:** Aryabhata's work was highly influential in Indian astronomy and mathematics and was translated into Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age, impacting the development of science in the Middle East. In modern India, the first satellite was named Aryabhata in his honor, and his image has appeared on Indian currency.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Which match are you creating a team for?** (e.g., a specific T20, ODI, or Test match between two particular teams)\n",

            "**General Dream11 Team Building Tips:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Research the Teams and Players:**\n",
            "    * Check recent player form (runs scored, wickets taken, etc.).\n",
            "    * Consider the venue and pitch conditions (is it batting-friendly or bowling-friendly?).\n",
            "    * Look at head-to-head records between the teams and key players.\n",
            "    * Stay updated on any player injuries or news that might affect their availability.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Consider the Pitch Report:**\n",
            "    * A batting-friendly pitch might suggest picking more batsmen and fewer bowlers.\n",
            "    * A bowling-friendly pitch might mean selecting more quality bowlers and all-rounders.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Balance Your Team:**\n",
            "    * Try to have a good mix of batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and a wicket-keeper.\n",
            "    * Don't overload on players from just one team.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Captain and Vice-Captain Choices are Crucial:**\n",
            "    * The captain earns 2x points, and the vice-captain earns 1.5x points.\n",
            "    * Choose players who are likely to perform well in that particular match. Consistent performers or players due for a big game are good options.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Utilize Player Credits Wisely:**\n",
            "    * Dream11 assigns credits to each player. You need to build a team within a specific credit limit.\n",
            "    * Don't just pick all the star players, as you might run out of credits. Look for value picks who might perform well despite having lower credits.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Consider All-Rounders:**\n",
            "    * All-rounders can give you points with both bat and ball, making them valuable assets to your team.\n",
            "\n",
            "7.  **Stay Updated with the Toss:**\n",
            "    * The playing XI might change after the toss. Try to make final adjustments to your team based on the confirmed lineups.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Once you tell me the specific match, I can try to give you a more informed suggestion based on available news and predictions.** Remember that Dream11 involves an element of chance, and these are just tips to increase your probability of success.\n",
